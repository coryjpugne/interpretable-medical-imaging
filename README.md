# Interpretable Medical Imaging

Tools and experiments for evaluating **interpretability and localization reliability**
in chest X-ray deep learning models.

## Why this project
High model performance can still happen when a model focuses on spurious regions.
This repo supports analysis that connects **where the model looks** to **how it performs**.

## What’s inside (in progress)
- Model evaluation metrics
- Localization / interpretability analyses (e.g., CAM-based)
- Figures and examples for reporting results

## Status
Actively being cleaned and packaged for public release.
